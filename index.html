  <h1>BLuE Crickets</h1>
  <p>We live in an ever growing ecosystem of connected devices. Some of these networks are at the forefront of our lives, for example we might immediately recognize when the wifi goes out or we canâ€™t get a mobile data signal. But there other networks that are less visible, were we might not even realize that we are a persistent node always sending and receiving tiny bits of data.</p>

  <p>BLuE Crickets scans for Bluetooth Low Energy devices. It translates the number and signal strength of nearby devices into sound and light, seeking to focus attention on one often ignored system in our lives.</p>
